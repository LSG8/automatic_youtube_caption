Many foreigners think that India is a very Spiritual Country

0:00:35.488,0:00:38.460
Spiritual, not religious

0:00:38.460,0:00:44.589
India means vegetarian people, guruji's ashram (monastery), monks, practising yoga, etc.

0:00:44.589,0:00:50.461
Internet search result shows India is at the top of the list of world's most spiritual countries

0:00:56.442,0:01:05.507
But I have never been spiritually conscious during my upbringing in an urban Bengali family

0:01:10.498,0:01:16.663
I never bothered about the differences between spirituality and religion

0:01:22.682,0:01:27.384
I always believed monks stay in remote caves in the Himalayas

0:01:27.384,0:01:31.966
Eat fruits and vegetables available in the mountain

0:01:31.966,0:01:35.930
Meditate the whole day. And goes to Allahabad during the Kumbh mela

0:01:35.930,0:01:45.912
So, when one of my Finnish colleagues told me a story of an Indian guruji, I didn't care much

0:01:45.912,0:01:53.912
He was very excited about that guru and wanted to share his story with me for the obvious reason

0:01:53.912,0:02:01.912
But to me, such gurus are not at all important and sometimes sceptical too

0:02:02.903,0:02:07.186
But, he might think that Indians are always fond of gurus

0:02:07.186,0:02:12.334
After going to Haridwar and Rishikesh, I got the reason behind this kind of perception of Indians

0:02:12.334,0:02:17.509
like they all are vegetarians, this is the most spiritual country etc.

0:02:18.500,0:02:22.463
Pilgrims start their journey towards Badrinath from Haridwar itself

0:02:22.463,0:02:26.683
Badrinath is a Vishnu pilgrimage site

0:02:26.977,0:02:30.793
Again, pilgrims start their journey towards Kedarnath from Haridwar as well

0:02:30.793,0:02:34.537
Kedarnath is a place for Shiva

0:02:34.537,0:02:41.840
So, to the Vaishnavas, this place is known as Haridwar (gate to Hari = gate to Vishnu)

0:02:41.840,0:02:47.014
And to the Shaivites, this place is known as Haradwar (gate to Hara = gate to Shiva)

0:02:47.014,0:02:50.500
Again, according to Hindu mythology, the holy river Ganges / Ganga

0:02:50.500,0:02:54.244
gets released from the hair bun of Shiva and starts flowing from this place

0:02:54.500,0:03:01.069
And Geographically Ganga River starts from the Gomukh glacier and flows through the Himalayas up to this place,

0:03:01.069,0:03:07.125
then enters into the long Gangetic valley. So this area is also known as Gangadwar (gate to Ganga)

0:03:15.969,0:03:19.125
So, at the foothills of the Shibalik Range of the Himalayas,

0:03:19.125,0:03:24.079
Haridwar, a town at 250km north of Delhi is a significant one in Hindu mythology

0:03:24.079,0:03:29.070
and it is also an important gateway for the Hindu pilgrims

0:03:33.070,0:03:37.144
But if you want to feel like a pilgrimage without going to Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, Yamunotri,

0:03:37.144,0:03:40.116
then also Haridwar is a good option.

0:03:47.126,0:03:50.098
Before talking about the famous Kumbh Mela (Kumbh fair), first, I should say

0:03:50.098,0:03:54.135
that this is the place of numerous Hindu temples and ashrams (monasteries)

0:04:01.144,0:04:05.144
Chandi devi temple, Manasa devi temple, Daksh Mahadev temple,

0:04:05.144,0:04:09.145
a mini version of the original Vaishno devi temple, Pawandham,

0:04:09.145,0:04:13.145
Bharatmata temple, Saptarishi ashram, and a lot of others

0:04:27.127,0:04:31.567
There is an altar for Daksha Prajapati in this Daksha Mahadev temple

0:04:31.567,0:04:35.531
Daksha Prajapati, the father of Sati, performed his offering here

0:04:38.540,0:04:42.503
Anyway, this area of the town is named Kankhal

0:04:42.503,0:04:46.980
Mythologically every year Shiva spends some days here in Kankhal

0:04:46.980,0:04:49.990
Shiva offering is huge here during the birth month of Shiva (Shravan)

0:04:49.990,0:04:51.990
and Shivaratri (another Shiva festival) is also very special here

0:04:54.981,0:04:57.036
Well-known rudraksha beads come from the fruit of rudraksha trees

0:04:57.036,0:05:00.027
These trees are widely available here

0:05:01.036,0:05:07.018
Mythologically, gods and evils fought over the nectar found from the churning of the ocean

0:05:09.421,0:05:14.064
as a result, some drops of nectar spilt in some places

0:05:14.064,0:05:19.642
'Har ki pauri' ghat (bank) of the river Ganga at Haridwar is one of those holy places where nectar spilt

0:05:23.078,0:05:25.500
So, this Har ki pauri ghat became holy from then

0:05:28.745,0:05:32.268
The famous Ganga arati (the river Ganga worshipping with lights) here is one of the best attractions of Haridwar

0:05:45.421,0:05:50.045
Going to the ghat, got a huge crowd gathered to see the arati (river worshipping with lights)

0:05:50.045,0:05:54.441
and people are floating small lamps in the water

0:05:54.441,0:05:58.947
Many lamps are streaming through the river - a very nice scene

0:05:58.947,0:06:03.034
This place has been chosen as one of the venues of the world-famous Kumbh mela as nectar spilt here

0:06:10.028,0:06:14.836
I am now in Rishikesh, only 25 km north of Haridwar

0:06:14.836,0:06:18.836
Ramjhula and Lakshmanjhula are two very famous bridges here in Rishikesh

0:06:18.836,0:06:22.836
The bridge behind me is the Ramjhula

0:06:22.836,0:06:26.836
Lakshmanjhula is now closed due to some renovation work

0:06:26.836,0:06:30.836
This Ramjhula is an iron suspension bridge over the river Ganges/Ganga

0:06:34.421,0:06:38.506
Ganga is here very beautiful with bluish green colour

0:06:38.506,0:06:42.506
And today's sunny weather makes it more beautiful

0:06:47.901,0:06:54.433
If Haridwar is known as a Hindu religious place, then Rishikesh is a famous place for spiritualism.

0:06:55.424,0:07:03.791
In March every year, there is a week-long International Yoga Festival occurs here in Rishikesh

0:07:03.791,0:07:09.810
70 hours of long Yoga practice and several spiritual discussions take place in that festival

0:07:12.819,0:07:19.902
It is a saying that long-ago monks started practising yoga here in Rishikesh for the first time

0:07:19.902,0:07:23.865
That's why this town is known as the yoga capital of the world

0:07:25.847,0:07:30.838
At the foothills of the Himalayas, this small town is well known for its several monasteries and yoga centres

0:07:33.810,0:07:38.838
Anyone can go to any of these monasteries and spend some days for mental peace

0:07:39.315,0:07:44.269
These monasteries are spiritual retreats for common people

0:07:46.214,0:07:52.160
But not only common people, many famous people come to these monasteries

0:07:54.251,0:07:58.288
Even people from abroad have come several times like

0:08:03.793,0:08:09.738
yes, they were the members of the world-famous rock band of the sixties, The Beatles

0:08:11.756,0:08:16.747
In 1968, Beatles members came to the monastery of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi

0:08:17.738,0:08:22.729
That's why this monastery has been named the 'Beatles ashram'

0:08:22.729,0:08:28.674
The white album of The Beatles contains some songs that were written during their stay in Rishikesh

0:08:28.674,0:08:33.665
Ajay Bose made a documentary film named 'The Beatles and India' based on

0:08:33.665,0:08:38.693
their Rishikesh visit and love for Indian culture, and philosophy

0:08:41.665,0:08:45.666
There are several monasteries like the Beatles ashram in Rishikesh and Haridwar

0:08:45.666,0:08:49.666
I went to such a monastery in Haridwar named Shanti Kunj

0:08:50.436,0:08:53.189
Shanti Kunj is also a world-famous monastery

0:08:53.189,0:08:57.189
This monastery is also the headquarters of the world Gayatri family

0:09:00.198,0:09:03.281
The monastery is arranged in a well-decorated large area

0:09:03.281,0:09:06.767
A lot of residents are here

0:09:06.767,0:09:09.740
and some visitors are also here who can stay for a couple of days

0:09:09.740,0:09:13.373
A peaceful meditation hall is also there

0:09:17.373,0:09:23.758
Located amidst green Himalayan ranges with a clear bluish-green  river Ganga flowing through,

0:09:23.758,0:09:30.731
Haridwar and Rishikesh could have been famous tourist places for only natural beauty

0:09:30.731,0:09:36.676
But the mythological, religious, and spiritual backgrounds of these two places

0:09:36.676,0:09:42.658
have made them somewhat different from other natural tourist places

0:09:42.658,0:09:48.603
People from India and abroad always prefer these two places seeking mental peace.
